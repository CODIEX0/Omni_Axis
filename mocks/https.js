// This file mocks the Node.js 'https' module for React Native environments.
// Since 'https' is typically used for server-side operations,
// we provide a minimal mock that likely won't be used by client code.
// If client code *does* rely on 'https' APIs, a more complete polyfill
// or alternative approach would be needed.

// console.warn("Using mock 'https' module. Node.js 'https' is not available in React Native.");
